# My Python App

This project is a simple Streamlit application that utilizes Pandas and NumPy for data processing. The application is structured to separate the main application logic from utility functions, making it modular and easy to maintain.

## Project Structure

```
my-python-app
├── src
│   ├── app.py          # Main entry point of the Streamlit application
│   └── utils.py        # Utility functions for data processing
├── tests
│   └── test_app.py     # Test cases for the application
├── requirements.txt     # List of dependencies
└── README.md            # Project documentation
```

## Installation

To set up the project, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Then, install the required dependencies using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

To run the Streamlit application, execute the following command:

```
streamlit run src/app.py
```

This will start the Streamlit server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Running Tests

To run the test cases for the application, use the following command:

```
pytest tests/test_app.py
```

This will execute the tests defined in `test_app.py` and report any failures.
